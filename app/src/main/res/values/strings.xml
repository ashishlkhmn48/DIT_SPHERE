    <string name="help">WHY DIT-SPHERE?\n\n
DIT has been functioning with a website based system since its inception providing the information related with news, announcement and Upcoming events detail whereas every other institution is using all the modern amenities like Applications for all these things.

So, being a reputed technical university, DIT should also have an Application based student portal where students can track the updates via live notification system.

\n\nBeing a DIT-ian, many of us face several problems like:

Not getting aware of every news, announcement or upcoming event at time.
Less interaction between Junior and senior.
Issue in calculation pointers.
Clubs have to do publicity in classes which is time wasting for Members as well as Disturbances for classes.
\n\n** The Student portal will help Student for the following things:\n\n

=> News and Upcoming Events Notifications\n
=> Discussion forum\n
=> Profanity Filter for Discussion Forum\n
=> Club Events Notifier\n
=> Result section\n
=> Placement Cell\n
=> Faculty Interaction and Support\n
=> Pointer calculation System\n
=> And Much More..</string>
